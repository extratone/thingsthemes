# We Make Things

Based in Stuttgart, Cultured Code makes the award-winning productivity app THINGS for Mac, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro.

Founded in 2004, the privately held company started out making software for web developers. In 2007 they changed course to focus on Things, and found success the following summer when they launched their 1.0 on the same day the App Store debuted—becoming one of the first 500 apps.

Eighteen years later, the small development team of 12 continues to iterate on the product—now in its 3rd major version—shipping over 5 million units along the way, and winning many awards, including two Apple Design Awards.
